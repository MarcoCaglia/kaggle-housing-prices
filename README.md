# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This is meant to be one possible solution for the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". If you have any questions, comments or
criticism, I would be more than happy to hear it.

I consider this to be a work in progress, so the contents of this repository may very well change over time.

Out of the three notebooks in this repository "descriptive.ipynb" and "inductive.ipynb" are meant to be tinkering/sandox files for EDA and ML, respectively. The actual process of submitting solutions can be found in the "development.ipynb" file.

Thanks you for reading!
